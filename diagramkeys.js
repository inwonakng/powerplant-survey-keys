The power plant would guarantee an increase in everyone in the nation's (including you) income by
boosting the economy.
But it also comes with the risk of decreasing the lifespan of people in the city it is built.
If a power plant is not built in your city, it will <b>not</b> have any negative effects on you, but
it will still affect the residents of that city only. If it is built in your city, everyone in your
city (including you) face the risk.
You are a resident of <b>city ${city}</b>.`
